# Inyoka

The Inyoka portal system is divided into multiple modules
to which we refer as applications. The name Inyoka means ‚Äúsnake‚Äù in
[zulu](http://zu.wiktionary.org/wiki/snake) and was chosen because it's a Python application ü§ì.

Although the software is based on Django, it uses (sometimes and mostly for legacy reasons)
different idioms and the non standard template engine Jinja. The basic
application structure is explained below.

## Requirements

We're using the recent LTS Django releases. Django and all python-requirements
can be installed with `pip`.

The code is mostly tested with the database PostgreSQL. Theoretically, most functions should work with SQLite or
any other database Django supports. The preferred caching system is redis.

## Installation & Configuration

See in the documentation the files ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù and ‚Äúgetting_started‚Äù.

## Applications of Inyoka

The following applications are part of Inyoka so far:

 * `portal` The index application. It resides on no subdomain and is the portal page.
    It aggregates for example the recent ikhaya posts.

 * `forum`
    The forum component. It's inspired by [phpBB2](http://www.phpbb.com/) which was previously
    used on the German ubuntuusers.de webpage. Some of the functionality
    was extended over time though. Especially an improved notification
    system, attachments and subforums.

 * `wiki`
    [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/) inspired wiki engine. It's not as
    advanced as moin but has revisioned pages and a parser which can
    safely generate XML based output formats. The wiki parser also has some
    BBCode elements for compatibility with the old phpBB syntax and is
    used in other components (`forum`, `ikhaya`, ‚Ä¶) as well.

 * `planet`
    A planet like feed aggregator. It archives and sanitizes input data
    thanks to feedparser.

 * `ikhaya`
    Ikhaya is zulu for [home](http://glosbe.com/zu/en/ikhaya) and a blog
    application. It's used on the German ubuntuusers portal for site wide
    announcements and other news. It doesn't show up on the planet
    automatically, for that you have to add the ikhaya feed to it like any
    other blog.

 * `pastebin`
    A pastebin that uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) for highlighting.
    It does not support diffing yet but allows to download pastes.
