In this folder are settings to test inyoka with different dabaseses.

To run the tests, call:

python manage.py --settings tests.settings.DATABASE

where DATABASE is sqlite, mysql or postgres.

To run the tests with a specific database server, the database has to be
installed and configured. There has also be a redis server for the tests to
work.

As default, the tests expect the database servers to run on localhost, but
another host can be used by creating a file custom.py in the settings folder
with the content:

test_host = MY_HOST_NAME
